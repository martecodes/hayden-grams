How it's made Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript,Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, MongoDB. Creating a collection that holds users posts. And another collection that holds comments based on that post.This project was fun to create.

Lesson Learned No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. This project brought a lot out of me. It really shows how well you need to do your research.
